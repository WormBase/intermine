# Simple script that extracts the XPATHs from a wrapped XML file
# A wrapper might need to be run on the XML file prior to run this script,
# and ideally all txt entries should be escaped (TODO)
# Items and fields with more than one [] entry are not included in the output
# the same way text() are not output. This script can be used in combination with
# check_xpaths.py
